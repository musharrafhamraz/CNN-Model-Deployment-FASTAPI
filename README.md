# CNN-Model-Deployment-FASTAPI
This repository contains code for deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. The deployed model can be accessed through a RESTful API, allowing users to make predictions on new data easily.

Features
FastAPI Integration: Utilizes FastAPI to create a robust, high-performance API endpoint for the CNN model.
Convolutional Neural Network: Implements a pre-trained CNN model for image classification tasks.
Easy Deployment: Offers straightforward deployment process, making it easy to deploy the model on various platforms.
Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for potential future enhancements and modifications.
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/cnn-model-deployment.git
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd cnn-model-deployment
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Server:
