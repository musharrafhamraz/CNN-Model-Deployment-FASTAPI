# CNN-Model-Deployment-FASTAPI
This repository contains code for deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. The deployed model can be accessed through a RESTful API, allowing users to make predictions on new data easily.
